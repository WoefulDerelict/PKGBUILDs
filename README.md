# PKGBUILDs
#####Package descriptions for the Arch Linux distribution and its spins.

  This is a catalogue of package descriptions with the intent of: patching issues in packages released to the public by the distribution's maintainers, updating packages in the AUR or customizing them to better meet my own needs. One has adhered to the Arch packaging standards (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_packaging_standards) as closely as possible.
  The Arch wiki article on creating packages (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/creating_packages) and the PKGBUILD manual page (https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/PKGBUILD.5.html) should be used as primary references and will answer most questions.
